    <h1>Actions in Kill Team</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>

    <p>Kill Team is Game's Workshop answer to the ever-present question "Just <em>how much</em> do I have to invest before I can start playing Warhammer...?".</p>
    <p>You buy (hopefully) a single box and you have enough models to play a skirmish game, "skirmish" being a type of wargame where each individual piece has more options and focus (as opposed to groups of models, or units, which is what normally happens in Warhammer 40k and similar games).</p>
    <p>This means that each individual piece has a lot more health and actions per turn compared to the base game. Which is always in the back of our mind: the rules themselves make use of a lot of concepts which are already present in Warhammer 40k (individual stats, special abilities, roll mechanics), often expanding them to compensate for the new scope.</p>
    <p>Which is the first thing we should keep in mind: despite the base mechanics of the game being pretty straightforward, the complexity quickly ramps up to a meaningful degree the moment we start to deviate from the very basic rules. I'm thinking stuff like:
        <ul>
            <li>individual model abilities, which often superseed or extend base rules;</li>
            <li>"stratagems", which are special actions which can be "bought" spending a resource called Command Points;</li>
            <li>special statuses like "wounded", "scarred", etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>This makes it so that the game will <em>not</em> be easy to pick up in a single session. The best way to approach it would be having someone (even a YouTube video) quckly introduce the base concepts of the game and then moving from one single, interesting topic to the next, testing everything as you learn it on the tabletop.</p>
    <p>That's precisely what me and my good friend Frank tried doing for an hour or so yesterday evening before the Lord of Sleep claimed my tired self.</p>

    <h2>Shooting, Charging, Moving</h2>
    <p>Frank is a Space Wolves player in base 40k. He had bought the Kill Team 2nd Edition rulebook used from Vinted in the hopes of trying it sooner or later. As such, he used a couple Primaris Intercessors models I had at my place.</p>
    <p>I started playing 40k when 8th Edition came out, so I'm a Death Guard player. Two Plague Marines represented my learning kill team.</p>
    <p>We used a normal d6 dice set for rolling dice, an old Games Workshop tape measure for calculating distances (not that we had to) and a paper mat from the first issue of Combat Patrol, which Frank bought to get a couple cool models. Luckily, this mat is the exact size needed for kill team.</p>

    <p>The first thing that surprises when looking at the operative sheet from Kill Team, compared to 40k, is that each one acts multiple times before they're done for that turn. They have a number of Action points they spend to perform actions when their turn is up (APL in their Datacard), and each actions costs a number of points (mostly 1, but there are exceptions).</p>
    <p>Given that once they're engaged in melee combat most of their options disappear, the optimal suggested turn for a given operative becomes something like Shoot - Charge - Fight, or some variation of it where fighting is the last thing they do.</p>
    <p>Shooting and fighting are pretty self-explanatory actions, and this is not the place to go in-depth for them. The difference between Moving and Charging is that Charging allows finishing one's movement engaged in melee combat with another operative (that wasn't already in melee, otherwise Moving is enough), and that Charging allows the operative to cover a little extra distance (which makes sense, given the nature of a charge compared to a simple movement).</p>

    <h2>Wounding and Defending</h2>
    <p>I like the rules about shooting and fighting, particularly as far as defending is concerned.</p>
    <p>There are always normal and critical hits (6s), as well as normal and critical defences. Defending successfully cancels out an attack of the given type (although multiple defences can block a critical hit), but this happens only when defending from a ranged attack.</p>
    <p>In melee, both models fight at the same time and alternate striking hits and blocking the other operative's attacks. After rolling (together), each operative basically has a successful dice pool (again taking notes of critical hits): starting from the attacker, players take turns deciding whether each die landed a hit (immediately inflicting damage) or blocked some of the opponent's ones (which removes the die from their pool). This was fun to do at the table: it better represents the exchange of blows in melee, including the ferocity of combat (considering that each strike shaves off multiple Wounds from the model Datacard, with crits dealing even higher damage).</p>
    
    <br>
    <p>All in all, exploring actions at the table as an isolated task was a much more pleasurable experience than pouring through the ruleset in a single go (and in isolation). This suggests that the "Blast Wave" way of approaching a new system has some merit, although I was surprised to see just how little energy I had left at the end of the day.</p>
